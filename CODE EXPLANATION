1. Finding Optimal Flight Routes:
calculate_total_time and calculate_total_cost:

These functions calculate the total travel time or cost based on the chosen route (order of visiting airports) and flight data (time/cost) for a specific airline.

find_optimal_flight_route:

This function takes various inputs including airport names, flight data, user-specified route, and the optimization criteria (time/cost). It iterates through flight data for different airlines and finds the route with the minimum total time or cost based on the user's preference.
It returns the optimal route, corresponding total value (time/cost), and the chosen airline.

2. User Interaction:
get_predefined_airports:

This function defines a list of airports the program considers.
get_user_selection: This function interacts with the user to get their desired travel route by prompting them to choose airport names from the predefined list.
The main program loop allows users to specify their desired airports and then choose between optimizing for travel time or cost

3. Additional Functionalities (not fully optimized):

The code calculates the total cost considering the number of adult and child passengers.
It offers discounts based on user-selected categories (student, doctor, etc.) but the discount logic is not optimized (doesn't consider the number of passengers).
It offers the option to explore business class fares for the chosen airline based on a simple multiplier on the economy class cost.
Overall, this code provides a good foundation for a flight recommendation system. Here are some potential improvements:

Error handling: The code could be improved by adding more error handling for invalid user inputs.
Discount logic: The discount calculations can be optimized to consider the number of passengers and potentially other factors.
Search by date: The program could be enhanced to allow searching for flights based on specific dates.
Layovers: The system could be extended to explore routes with layovers (considering factors like total travel time and cost).
API integration: Integrating with real-time flight data APIs could provide more up-to-date information.
